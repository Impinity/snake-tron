SNAKE

Snake is a simple game that doesn't really require much explanation.
Basically you can't crash into yourself or out of bounds and the 
goal is to eat as many dots as possible to increase your size,
as the Size increases so the does the difficulty of not running
into yourself.

An extra feature I implemented was support for 3 different difficulties
each difficulty increases the speed of your snake by decreasing the 
Timer delay.

Controls:
The game typically uses the up, down, left, right keys to control 
the snake but I also added support for W, A, S, D

TRON

Rules and Controls:
Tron is TWO PLAYERS where the red player uses WASD and the blue 
player uses the up down left right arrow keys. The point of the 
game is for your "tron lightbike" to survive the longest. There's
a sense of competition because your player can't crash into 
the other player so a strategy is to trap another person with your
body.

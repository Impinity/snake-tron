# Snake and Tron

**Snake**

Snake is a simple, well known game that doesn't require much explanation.
Basically, you can't crash into yourself or out of bounds and the 
goal is to eat as many dots as possible to increase your size,
as the size increases so the does the difficulty of not running
into yourself.

An extra feature I implemented was support for 3 different difficulties
each difficulty increases the speed of your snake by decreasing the 
Timer delay.

*Controls:*
The game typically uses the up, down, left, right keys to control 
the snake but I also added support for W, A, S, D

**TRON**

Tron is a two player game in which two players (blue and red) compete
to survive the longest as their "lightbikes" continuously grow.

*Controls:*
Red player uses W, A, S, and D. Blue players uses up, down,
left, and right.
